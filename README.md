# Elsa's Farm
A nice farm in Riverwood to serve as a player home. This mod does not require any DLC and can be used with Vanilla Skyrim Special Edition.

I created the farm as a player home for one of my characters who happens to be named Elsa. I decided to create the farm for using [Alternate Start - Live Another Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272) where I could be a patron at an Inn. The sensible place to start would be the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood.
